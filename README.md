# FileCabinet – Recruitment Task

Implementation of the `Cabinet` interface for a hierarchical folder structure.

The solution handles nested folders (`MultiFolder`) using recursive tree traversal.

Traversal logic is centralized in a single private method to avoid code duplication and ensure clean handling of the folder hierarchy.

Java `Optional` is used to avoid returning `null`.
